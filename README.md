# Dotfiles
Collection of my personal dotfiles.

My configuration files for oh-my-zsh (and zsh), nvim, vscode and so forth.

To install NvChad (Nvim distribution of my choice):

`git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1 && nvim`

The intention is to be able to run a setup script to install, but still work in progress.
